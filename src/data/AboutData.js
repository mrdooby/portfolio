const text = `Hello! I am Clayton Chin, a full-stack software engineer based in California.\n
I have experience developing web and mobile applications and am also actively looking to broaden my knowledge. Currently, I am beefing up my technical skills by learning new libraries and applying them in my personal projects.\n
I enjoy adding a nerdy twist to applications and spend some of my free time playing fantasy-themed, campaign-based board games.\n
Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to chat!`
